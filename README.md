With Spent, you can create budgets, set spending goals, and store information about your recent purchases. The interactive dashboard features graphs, which segment the user’s expenditures into categories, and auto updating widgets, which illustrate spending metrics and statistics.

Spent is a Flask app built on a Flask server with a PostgreSQL database, with SQLAlchemy as the ORM used to interact with this database. The front end templating uses Jinja. HTML was built using Bootstrap. The Javascript uses JQuery and AJAX to interact with the backend so everything updates in real time. The graphs displaying total and average spent are rendered using Chart.js, a free Javascript charting library. The map is built using the Google Maps API, which interacts with the Shippo package tracking API.
